# Control Flow

Rust provides several control flow statements that allow you to make decisions, repeat actions, and branch based on certain conditions. The main control flow constructs in Rust are:

## If-else Expression

The if statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code based on a boolean expression. It can be followed by an optional else block to specify an alternative action when the condition is false.

```rust
if condition {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 0;

    if number > 1 {
        println!("Number is greater than 1");
    } else {
        println!("Number is less than or equal to 1");
    }
}
```

## If-else Expression (with multiple conditions)

You can chain multiple else if blocks to check multiple conditions in sequence.

Syntax:

```rust
if conditionone {
    // Code to execute if conditionone is true
} else if conditiontwo {
    // Code to execute if conditiontwo is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if none of the conditions is true
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = -1;

    if number > 1 {
        println!("Number is greater than 1");
    } else if number == 1 {
        println!("Number is exactly 1");
    } else {
        println!("Number is less than 1");
    }
}
```

## Loop

The loop statement creates an infinite loop that keeps executing a block of code until you explicitly break out of it using the break statement.

```rust
loop {
    // Code to execute repeatedly until a break statement is encountered
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;

    loop {
        println!("Count: {}", count);
        count += 1;
        if count >= 5 {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

## While

The while loop continues executing a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true.

```rust
while condition {
    // Code to execute repeatedly as long as the condition is true
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;

    while count < 5 {
        println!("Count: {}", count);
        count += 1;
    }
}
```

## for..in (Iterators)

The for..in loop iterates over elements in an iterator, such as arrays or ranges.

```rust
for item in iterable {
    // Code to execute for each item in the iterable
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    for num in numbers.iter() {
        println!("Number: {}", num);
    }
}
```

## Match Expression

The match expression is a powerful way to handle multiple cases based on the value of a variable. It is similar to a "switch" or "case" statement in other languages.

```rust
match variable {
    patternone => {
        // Code to execute if variable matches patternone
    }
    patterntwo => {
        // Code to execute if variable matches patterntwo
    }
    _ => {
        // Code to execute if none of the patterns match (optional, but recommended)
    }
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let day = "Tuesday";

    match day {
        "Monday" => println!("It's the beginning of the week"),
        "Friday" => println!("It's the end of the week"),
        _ => println!("It's a regular day"),
    }
}
```
