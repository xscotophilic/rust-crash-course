# Getting Started

## Origin Story

In the mid-2000s, Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla Research employee, began working on a personal project with the aim of creating a new systems programming language. His motivation stemmed from his frustration with the limitations and safety issues in existing languages like C and C++. Graydon envisioned a language that could provide the same level of performance and control as C and C++ but with built-in safety features to prevent common programming errors.

Graydon's project gained attention within Mozilla, and by 2009, he was joined by Dave Herman and others, who shared his vision for a new programming language. Together, they started building the language from scratch, focusing on key principles such as safety, concurrency, and performance.

The name "Rust" was chosen for the language as a reference to a specific type of fungus known for its resilience and ability to manage resources efficiently in the natural world. The team felt that this name accurately represented the language's goals of memory safety and robustness.

Throughout its development, Rust's design and features were shaped through open discussions and community involvement. Decisions were made using the RFC (Request for Comments) process, allowing developers outside the core team to contribute to the language's evolution.

In July 2010, the Rust project was publicly announced, and its development continued to gain momentum. The language received valuable feedback from early adopters and contributors, leading to continuous improvements and refinements.

Rust reached version 1.0 on May 15, 2015, marking a significant milestone in its journey. The 1.0 release indicated that the language had reached a level of stability and maturity suitable for production use.

Since then, Rust has seen substantial growth in popularity and adoption. Its emphasis on safety, memory safety in particular, has garnered praise from developers across different domains, including systems programming, web development, networking, and more.

Today, Rust continues to thrive with an active community that contributes to its development, maintains a rich ecosystem of libraries, and supports developers worldwide. The language's origin story is a testament to the determination of a few passionate individuals and the collaborative effort of an engaged community, culminating in the creation of a powerful, modern, and safe programming language - Rust.

## Features

Rust is a contemporary, systems-level programming language that prioritises safety, speed, and concurrency. Mozilla Research first released it in 2010 and it has since acquired substantial popularity among developers due to its comprehensive features and ability to prevent common programming problems such as null pointer dereferences and data races. Rust achieves these objectives through the use of its ownership system and borrow checker.

Key features and concepts of Rust:

1. **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust's ownership model ensures that every value in Rust has a unique owner, and the memory allocated to a value is deallocated automatically when the owner goes out of scope. This prevents many common bugs like double frees and null pointer dereferences. When you need to work with a value without transferring ownership, you can use borrowing, which allows multiple read-only references or one mutable reference to the value.

2. **Concurrency**: Rust has first-class support for concurrent programming. The type system enforces thread safety, and its standard library provides useful constructs like threads, channels, and atomic operations.

3. **Memory Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety without relying on garbage collection. The borrow checker analyzes the code at compile time to ensure there are no data races or invalid memory accesses.

4. **Traits and Generics**: Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other languages and enable code reuse through a form of ad-hoc polymorphism. Generics allow writing code that can work with different types, making Rust highly expressive and reusable.

5. **Pattern Matching**: Rust's pattern matching system allows you to match data structures against patterns and execute code based on those patterns. It's a powerful feature used in error handling, control flow, and more.

6. **Error Handling**: Rust has an expressive and robust error handling mechanism using the Result and Option enums. This ensures that error conditions are explicitly handled in the code.

7. **Cargo**: Rust comes with a package manager called Cargo, which handles project management, dependency management, and building. Cargo simplifies the process of creating, building, and sharing Rust projects.

8. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and active community that contributes to its development, writes libraries, and provides support through forums, chat rooms, and other channels.

Rust is commonly used for systems programming, command-line tools, web services, game development, and more. Its focus on safety, performance, and reliability makes it an excellent choice for various application domains.
