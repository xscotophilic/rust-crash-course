# Structs

a struct (short for "structure") is a custom data type that allows you to group together different fields of varying types under a single name. This grouping makes it easier to manage and manipulate related data as a cohesive unit. Structs are a fundamental building block for creating complex data structures and representing objects in your Rust programs.

## Example

```rust
struct MyStruct {
    field1: FieldType1,
    field2: FieldType2,
    // ... more fields
}
```

- Here, MyStruct is the name of the struct.
- Here, FieldType1, FieldType2, etc., are the types of the fields within the struct.

Here's a simple example of how you might define and use a struct in Rust:

```rust
struct Fox {
    name: String,
    life: u32,
    is_orange: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let fox = Fox {
        name: String::from("Gandalf the orange fox"),
        age: 10,
        is_orange: false,
    };

    println!("Name: {}", fox.name);
    println!("Life: {}", fox.life);
    println!("Is Orange: {}", fox.is_orange);
}
```

Structs can also have associated functions called "methods" that operate on instances of the struct. Here's a simplified example:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // Method to calculate the area of the rectangle
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
}
```

Overall, structs in Rust provide a powerful way to define custom data types and encapsulate related data and behavior. They play a central role in Rust's approach to managing complexity, ensuring memory safety, and enabling efficient code
