# Memory Safety

In Rust, variables must always be initialized before they are used. If a variable is not initialized, the Rust compiler will raise a compilation error, and the code will not compile until the issue is fixed. This behavior is a significant departure from languages like C and C++, where uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior, security vulnerabilities, and bugs.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32; // Rust will raise a compilation error for this line

    // Attempting to use x here would result in a compilation error
    // because x is uninitialized
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

In this example, we declare the variable x of type i32, but we do not initialize it with any value. If you try to compile this code, the Rust compiler will raise the following error:

```bash
error[E0381]: borrow of possibly-uninitialized variable: `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:28
  |
4 |     println!("x: {}", x);
  |                       ^
  |                       |
  |                       use of possibly-uninitialized `x`
  |                       help: add explicit braces to avoid this ambiguity

```

The compiler error clearly indicates that x is considered possibly uninitialized, and using it would be unsafe.

This behavior showcases Rust's focus on memory safety by enforcing initialization rules and preventing the use of uninitialized variables. This design ensures that Rust code is more robust and secure, eliminating a significant source of potential bugs and vulnerabilities.
