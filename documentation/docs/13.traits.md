# Traits

traits are a fundamental concept that allows you to define shared behavior and functionality that can be implemented by different types. Traits provide a way to define methods that can be used by multiple types, enabling code reuse and abstracting over different data structures. They are similar to interfaces in other programming languages but offer additional capabilities and flexibility

Here are the key aspects of traits in Rust:

1. Trait Declaration: Traits are declared using the `trait` keyword, followed by the trait's name and a set of method signatures. These method signatures define the interface that types implementing the trait must adhere to.

2. Method Implementation: Types that implement a trait provide implementations for its methods. This is done using the `impl` keyword followed by the trait name and the corresponding methods' implementations.

3. Trait Bounds: When defining generic functions or structs, you can use trait bounds to specify that the generic type must implement a certain trait. This ensures that the functions or structs can only work with types that provide the required behavior.

4. Default Implementations: Traits can provide default implementations for methods. This means that implementing types can choose to use the default implementation or override it with their own custom implementation.

## Example

```rust
// Define a trait named `Shape` with a method `area`.
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

// Implement the `Shape` trait for a struct `Circle`.
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}

// Implement the `Shape` trait for a struct `Rectangle`.
struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn print_area(shape: &impl Shape) {
    println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 3.0 };
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 4.0, height: 5.0 };

    print_area(&circle);
    print_area(&rectangle);
}
```

### Another example:

Imagine you're creating a program about different animals. In this code, you're focusing on sheep.

First, you define what a sheep looks like. A sheep has a name (like "Dolly") and it can be naked or not (like when they're sheared for wool).

Then, you define a set of things that all animals can do, like making noise and talking. This is like giving animals a common language to communicate.

For sheep, you specify exactly how they do these things. For example, a sheep might make a noise like "baaaaah!" when it's not naked, but if it's naked, it might make a confused noise like "baaaaah?".

You also give sheep the ability to get a haircut (shearing), but if they're already naked, you remind them that they don't need another haircut.

In the main part of the program, you create a sheep named "Dolly". Dolly talks, gets a haircut (if needed), and talks again, but now she might sound a bit different.

The code helps you organize and define these behaviors for your sheep in a clear and consistent way, making it easier to manage and work with different kinds of animals in your program.

```rust
struct Sheep { naked: bool, name: &'static str }

trait Animal {
    // Associated function signature; `Self` refers to the implementor type.
    fn new(name: &'static str) -> Self;

    // Method signatures; these will return a string.
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str;

    // Traits can provide default method definitions.
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("{} says {}", self.name(), self.noise());
    }
}

impl Sheep {
    fn is_naked(&self) -> bool {
        self.naked
    }

    fn shear(&mut self) {
        if self.is_naked() {
            // Implementor methods can use the implementor's trait methods.
            println!("{} is already naked...", self.name());
        } else {
            println!("{} gets a haircut!", self.name);

            self.naked = true;
        }
    }
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Sheep`.
impl Animal for Sheep {
    // `Self` is the implementor type: `Sheep`.
    fn new(name: &'static str) -> Sheep {
        Sheep { name: name, naked: false }
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        self.name
    }

    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        if self.is_naked() {
            "baaaaah?"
        } else {
            "baaaaah!"
        }
    }
    
    // Default trait methods can be overridden.
    fn talk(&self) {
        // For example, we can add some quiet contemplation.
        println!("{} pauses briefly... {}", self.name, self.noise());
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Type annotation is necessary in this case.
    let mut dolly: Sheep = Animal::new("Dolly");
    // TODO ^ Try removing the type annotations.

    dolly.talk();
    dolly.shear();
    dolly.talk();
}
```
