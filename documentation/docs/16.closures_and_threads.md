# Closures and Threads

## Closures

A closure in Rust is an anonymous function that can capture variables from its surrounding scope. It is similar to a lambda function or a function object in other programming languages. Closures are a way to create functions on-the-fly, often used for short and specific operations.

Here's a basic example of a closure in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let add = |a, b| a + b;

    let result = add(3, 5);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

Closures can also capture variables from their surrounding scope, Closures can capture variables by value (`move` keyword) or by reference. They allow for more concise and expressive code, especially when working with iterators and higher-order functions.

## Threads

Threads allow you to achieve concurrent and parallel execution. The std::thread module provides facilities for creating and managing threads. Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps prevent common threading issues like data races.

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 0..5 {
            println!("Thread: {}", i);
        }
    });

    for i in 0..3 {
        println!("Main thread: {}", i);
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

In this example, two threads are created: the main thread and a spawned thread. They both execute concurrently, and the `join` method is used to wait for the spawned thread to finish before the main thread continues.

Rust's type system ensures that data accessed by multiple threads is properly synchronized, preventing data races and ensuring thread safety. Rust provides synchronization primitives like Mutex, Arc, and more to facilitate safe concurrent programming.

Combining closures and threads, you can create flexible and concurrent programs in Rust that take advantage of the language's safety guarantees.

### Crossbeam

it is a Rust library that provides a set of powerful and efficient concurrency primitives for building concurrent and parallel applications. It aims to make concurrent programming in Rust safer and more ergonomic by offering abstractions and tools that help prevent common threading issues like data races and deadlocks.

Crossbeam provides several modules and data structures that are particularly useful for concurrent programming:

**Atomic Types**: Crossbeam extends Rust's atomic types with additional abstractions, such as atomic reference counting and atomic cell types, which can be useful for building complex data structures shared across threads.

**Channels**: Crossbeam's channel implementations provide a way for threads to communicate and send data to each other safely. Channels are a fundamental primitive for building concurrent systems.

**Epoch-based Reclamation**: Crossbeam's epoch-based reclamation mechanism helps manage memory reclamation in lock-free data structures, addressing the ABA problem and helping to avoid memory leaks.

**Scoped Threads**: Crossbeam's scoped threads provide a safer way to work with threads by ensuring that spawned threads cannot outlive the scope they were created in, helping to prevent issues related to dangling references.

**Memory Management**: Crossbeam includes utilities for memory management in concurrent data structures, including techniques like hazard pointers and epoch tracking.

**Lock-Free Data Structures**: Crossbeam provides implementations of various lock-free data structures, such as queues and stacks, that can be safely shared between threads without using traditional locks.

**Epochs and Hazard Pointers**: These concepts help manage memory reclamation in lock-free data structures, ensuring that memory isn't prematurely freed while it's still being accessed by other threads.

It's important to note that the state of libraries and tools in the Rust ecosystem can change over time. If you're interested in using Crossbeam or any other concurrency-related libraries, I recommend checking the latest documentation and resources for the most up-to-date information on how to use them effectively and safely in your Rust projects.

Simple Example
```rust
use crossbeam::channel;
use crossbeam::thread;

fn main() {
    // Create a channel for sending and receiving results
    let (sender, receiver) = channel::unbounded();

    // Define the number of threads
    let num_threads = 4;

    // Define the range of numbers to sum
    let start = 1;
    let end = 10;

    // Split the range into chunks for each thread
    let chunk_size = (end - start + 1) / num_threads;
    let mut threads = Vec::with_capacity(num_threads);

    // Spawn scoped threads
    // divide the total range of numbers to be summed into smaller chunks,
    // and then spawning multiple threads to calculate 
    // the sum of numbers in each chunk.
    for i in 0..num_threads {
        let sender = sender.clone();

        let thread_start = start + i * chunk_size;
        let thread_end = thread_start + chunk_size - 1;
        // The above code calculates the starting and ending numbers for the current thread's chunk. For example, if start is 1, end is 10, chunk_size is 3, and i is 1, then thread_start would be 4 (1 + 1 * 3), and thread_end would be 6 (4 + 3 - 1).

        threads.push(thread::scope(|s| {
            // Inside the thread's scope
            s.spawn(move |_| {
                // Calculate the sum of numbers in the assigned range
                let sum = (thread_start..=thread_end).sum();
                // Send the sum through the channel
                sender.send(sum).unwrap();
            })
        }));
    }

    // Collect results from threads
    let mut total_sum = 0;
    for _ in 0..num_threads {
        total_sum += receiver.recv().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Total Sum: {}", total_sum);
}
```

1. Calculating the Number of Pizzas for Each Friend

- You have a big pile of pizza ingredients and a total number of pizzas you need to make (let's say 20 pizzas). To divide the work among your friends, you:
    - Count how many friends are helping (let's say 4 friends).
    - Divide the total number of pizzas (20) by the number of friends (4) to determine how many pizzas each friend should make.
    - Assign an equal number of pizzas to each friend. For example, if each friend needs to make 5 pizzas, you ensure that they have enough ingredients for those 5 pizzas.

2. Preparing Pizzas with Help from Friends:

- Now that you've divided the work, it's time to start making pizzas with your friends. Here's what you do:
    - You give each friend a specific recipe and the ingredients they need to make their assigned number of pizzas.
    - Each friend follows the recipe, prepares their pizzas, and puts them in the oven.
    - While your friends are busy making pizzas, you're also making your own pizzas using a similar recipe.

3. Collecting and Serving the Pizzas:

- As the pizzas come out of the oven, you and your friends put them on a table. Once all the pizzas are ready, you:
    - Count the total number of pizzas everyone has made.
    - Serve the pizzas to your hungry guests.
