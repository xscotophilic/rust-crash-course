# Scalar Types

Rust has several built-in scalar types. Scalar types represent a single value, as opposed to compound types like arrays or tuples, which can hold multiple values. Here are the primary scalar types in Rust:

## Integer Types

Integers are whole numbers without fractional parts.

### Signed Integers

Can represent both positive and negative values.

- i8: 8-bit signed integer
- i16: 16-bit signed integer
- i32: 32-bit signed integer
- i64: 64-bit signed integer
- i128: 128-bit signed integer (requires the i128 feature)
- isize: Platform-specific signed integer (size depends on the architecture)

### Unsigned Integers

Represent only non-negative values.

- u8: 8-bit unsigned integer
- u16: 16-bit unsigned integer
- u32: 32-bit unsigned integer
- u64: 64-bit unsigned integer
- u128: 128-bit unsigned integer (requires the i128 feature)
- usize: Platform-specific unsigned integer (size depends on the architecture)

## Floating-Point Types

Represent numbers with fractional parts.

- f32: 32-bit floating-point number (single-precision)
- f64: 64-bit floating-point number (double-precision) - More commonly used

## Boolean Type

bool: Represents a boolean value (true or false).

## Character Type

char: Represents a single Unicode character.

Rust also has a special type () known as "unit" type, which represents an empty tuple used when there is no meaningful value to return.

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_integer: i32 = 0;
    let my_float: f64 = 3.14;
    let my_bool: bool = true;
    let my_char: char = 'A';
    
    println!("Integer: {}", my_integer);
    println!("Float: {}", my_float);
    println!("Boolean: {}", my_bool);
    println!("Character: {}", my_char);
}
```
