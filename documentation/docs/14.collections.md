# Collections

"collections" refer to data structures that allow you to store and manage multiple values of the same or different types. Rust provides several built-in collection types that serve various purposes, such as storing sequences of elements, mapping keys to values, and ensuring ownership and borrowing rules are upheld. The main collection types in Rust are:

1. **Vec (Vector):** A dynamically sized array that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous memory block. Vectors can grow or shrink in size dynamically, and they provide efficient random access to elements. Vectors are commonly used when you need a flexible list of items.

2. **String:** A dynamically sized, mutable string type that is guaranteed to be UTF-8 encoded. It is essentially a collection of characters. Rust's String type provides methods for various string manipulation operations.

3. **HashMap:** A hash map that allows you to associate keys with values. Each key in a HashMap must be unique, and you can efficiently retrieve values based on their keys. Hash maps are useful for implementing dictionaries or associative arrays.

4. **HashSet:** A hash set that stores a collection of unique values. It is similar to a HashMap, but it only stores the keys without associated values. Hash sets are useful when you need to maintain a collection of distinct elements.

5. **BTreeMap:** A map that stores its elements in a balanced binary search tree (B-tree) data structure. Unlike a HashMap, a BTreeMap maintains its elements in a sorted order based on the keys.

6. **BTreeSet:** A set that stores its elements in a balanced binary search tree (B-tree). Similar to BTreeMap, a BTreeSet maintains its elements in sorted order.

7. **VecDeque (Vector Deque):** A double-ended queue that allows efficient insertion and removal of elements at both ends. It combines the properties of a vector and a deque.

8. **LinkedList:** A doubly-linked list that allows flexible insertion and removal of elements anywhere in the list. Linked lists are useful when you need to frequently modify the list structure.

These collection types are provided by the Rust standard library and are part of the core language. They are designed to be efficient and safe to use, following Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. Rust's ownership model ensures that collections manage memory correctly and prevent common programming errors like use-after-free or data races. When working with collections, you may also encounter concepts such as iterators, which provide a way to traverse and manipulate the elements of a collection in a safe and ergonomic manner.

## Vec (Vector)

```rust
fn main() {
    // Creating a vector of integers
    let mut numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Adding an element to the vector
    numbers.push(6);

    // Accessing elements
    println!("First element: {}", numbers[0]);

    // Iterating over elements
    for num in &numbers {
        println!("{}", num);
    }
}
```

## String

```rust
fn main() {
    // Creating a mutable string
    let mut message = String::from("Hello, ");

    // Appending to the string
    message.push_str("world!");

    // Concatenating strings
    let name = "Foo";
    let greeting = format!("{} {}", message, name);

    println!("{}", greeting);
}
```

## HashMap

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    // Creating a HashMap of strings to integers
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Foo"), 42);
    scores.insert(String::from("Bar"), 73);
    
    // Accessing values
    if let Some(score) = scores.get("Foo") {
        println!("Foo's score: {}", score);
    }

    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (name, score) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", name, score);
    }
}
```

## HashSet

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn main() {
    // Creating a HashSet of integers
    let mut set: HashSet<i32> = HashSet::new();

    set.insert(1);
    set.insert(2);
    set.insert(3);
    
    // Checking for membership
    if set.contains(&3) {
        println!("Set contains 3!");
    }

    // Iterating over elements
    for num in &set {
        println!("{}", num);
    }
}
```

## BTreeMap

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    // Creating a BTreeMap of strings to integers
    let mut grades = BTreeMap::new();

    grades.insert(String::from("Alice"), 95);
    grades.insert(String::from("Bob"), 87);
    
    // Accessing values
    if let Some(grade) = grades.get("Alice") {
        println!("Alice's grade: {}", grade);
    }

    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (name, grade) in &grades {
        println!("{}: {}", name, grade);
    }
}
```

## BTreeSet

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    // Creating a BTreeSet of integers
    let mut set: BTreeSet<i32> = BTreeSet::new();

    set.insert(3);
    set.insert(1);
    set.insert(2);
    
    // Checking for membership
    if set.contains(&1) {
        println!("Set contains 1!");
    }

    // Iterating over elements
    for num in &set {
        println!("{}", num);
    }
}
```

## VecDeque (Vector Deque)

```rust
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    // Creating a VecDeque of characters
    let mut deque: VecDeque<char> = VecDeque::new();

    deque.push_front('A');
    deque.push_back('Z');
    
    // Removing elements
    if let Some(front) = deque.pop_front() {
        println!("Front element: {}", front);
    }

    // Iterating over elements
    for ch in &deque {
        println!("{}", ch);
    }
}
```

## LinkedList

```rust
use std::collections::LinkedList;

fn main() {
    // Creating a LinkedList of strings
    let mut list: LinkedList<String> = LinkedList::new();

    list.push_back(String::from("Foo"));
    list.push_back(String::from("Bar"));
    list.push_back(String::from("Etc"));
    
    // Removing elements
    if let Some(first) = list.pop_front() {
        println!("First element: {}", first);
    }

    // Iterating over elements
    for name in &list {
        println!("{}", name);
    }
}
```

These examples showcase the basic usage of each collection type in Rust. Remember that Rust's ownership and borrowing rules apply to these collections, ensuring memory safety and preventing common programming errors.
