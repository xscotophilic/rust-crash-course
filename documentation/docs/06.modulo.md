# Modulo System

Rust has a powerful module system that allows developers to organize their code into logical units, manage code visibility, and create reusable components. Rust's module system provides a way to control the visibility of items (functions, structs, enums, etc.) and organize code into hierarchical structures. Here's an overview of the module system in Rust:

## Modules and Files

In Rust, each source file is a module by default. The contents of a file form the module's body.

You can define additional modules within a file using the mod keyword, followed by the module's name. This creates a submodule.

## Module Hierarchy

Modules can be nested to create a hierarchical structure. The module hierarchy is defined by using paths to access items in one module from another.

Modules can be nested inside other modules to create a tree-like structure. This provides a way to organize related functionality.

## Visibility

By default, items in a module are private to that module. They are not accessible from other modules in the same crate.

You can make items public by using the pub keyword. Public items are then accessible from other modules outside the current module.

## Importing Modules and Items

You can use the use keyword to bring a module or an item into the scope of another module or function.

This can help avoid repetitive code and make it easier to access items from deeply nested modules.

## File Structure and Module Visibility

The module hierarchy is reflected in the directory structure of the project.

By default, when a file is part of a directory hierarchy, it is also part of a module hierarchy. However, you can use the mod keyword to create submodules within files.

## Example

```
src/
  |- main.rs
  |- utils/
       |- mod.rs
       |- math.rs
```

In main.rs:

```rust
// Bring the `math` module into the scope
mod utils;

fn main() {
    let result = utils::math::add(2, 3);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In utils/mod.rs:

```rust
// Declare the `math` module and make it accessible
pub mod math;
```

In utils/math.rs:

```rust
// Function within the math module
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

In this example, the add function from the math module is made public, and the utils module is imported into the main.rs file. The add function is then called from the main function.

you can explore visibility modifiers, module hierarchy, and visibility rules. It's recommended to refer to the official Rust documentation for a comprehensive understanding of the module system and its various features.

### Visibility Modifiers

Visibility modifiers control which items (functions, structs, enums, etc.) are accessible outside the current module. The two main visibility modifiers in Rust are pub (public) and the absence of a modifier (private).

Let's create an example with a module containing public and private items:

In main.rs:

```rust
mod greetings {
    // This function is public and can be accessed from outside the module
    pub fn say_hello() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }

    // This function is private and can only be accessed within the module
    fn say_secret() {
        println!("Shh! This is a secret!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    greetings::say_hello(); // Can access the public function
    // greetings::say_secret(); // Error: The private function cannot be accessed from outside the module
}
```

say_hello is marked as public using pub, and it can be called from the main function. However, say_secret is private, and attempting to call it from main will result in a compilation error.

### Module Hierarchy

Module hierarchy in Rust allows you to organize related code in a tree-like structure. Let's consider an example where we have a module hierarchy with nested modules:

In main.rs:

```rust
mod fruits {
    pub mod apple {
        pub fn taste() {
            println!("The apple is sweet!");
        }
    }

    pub mod banana {
        pub fn taste() {
            println!("The banana is creamy!");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    fruits::apple::taste();
    fruits::banana::taste();
}
```

Here we have a top-level module called fruits, which contains two nested modules, apple and banana. Each nested module has a public function taste. The main function accesses these functions using the module hierarchy, specifying which module to call the taste function from.

### Visibility Rules

Visibility rules in Rust define what items can be accessed from where. Here's an example that demonstrates how visibility rules work:

In main.rs:

```rust
mod outer {
    pub fn public_function() {
        println!("This is a public function in the outer module!");
    }

    // This module is private to the `outer` module
    mod inner {
        pub fn private_function() {
            println!("This is a private function in the inner module!");
        }
    }

    pub fn call_private_function() {
        inner::private_function(); // We can still call the private function within the same module
    }
}

fn main() {
    outer::public_function();
    // outer::inner::private_function(); // Error: Cannot access the private function directly from outside the module
    outer::call_private_function(); // Calls the private function indirectly through a public function
}
```

Here, we have an outer module that contains a public function public_function. Inside the outer module, we have an inner module with a private function private_function. The private_function cannot be accessed directly from outside the outer module, but we can call it indirectly through the public function call_private_function.
