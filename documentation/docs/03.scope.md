# Scope

Scope refers to the region of a program where a particular binding (variable, reference, or any other named item) is valid and accessible. The scope determines the portion of the code where a binding can be used and where its value is guaranteed to be available.

Rust has a strong static (compile-time) type system and enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules to prevent data races and memory-related bugs. Understanding scope is crucial in Rust because it directly relates to ownership and borrowing concepts.

## Block Scope

Rust uses block scope, which means that variables and other named items introduced within a block (enclosed within curly braces {}) are only valid and accessible within that block.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Outer block scope
    {
        let x = 0; // This variable is only accessible within this block scope
        println!("x: {}", x);
    } // x goes out of scope and is dropped here

    // Attempting to use x here would result in a compilation error
}
```

## Nested Scopes

Rust allows nested scopes. Inner scopes can access variables from outer scopes, but not vice versa. When the inner scope ends, any variables declared within it go out of scope and are dropped.

```rust
fn main() {
    let outer_var = 01;

    {
        let inner_var = 0101;
        println!("inner_var: {}", inner_var);

        // We can access outer_var here
        println!("outer_var: {}", outer_var);
    } // inner_var goes out of scope and is dropped here

    // outer_var is still accessible here
    println!("outer_var: {}", outer_var);
}
```

## Function Scope

Variables declared as function parameters have function scope. They are only accessible within that specific function.

```rust
fn main() {
    fn my_function(x: i32) {
        println!("x: {}", x);
    }

    my_function(01);

    // Attempting to use x here would result in a compilation error
}
```

## Ownership and Drop

When variables go out of scope, Rust will automatically invoke the `drop` function for types that implement the `Drop` trait. This is where resources like memory, file handles, etc., can be cleaned up.

```rust
struct MyStruct;

impl Drop for MyStruct {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("MyStruct instance is being dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    {
        let _my_instance = MyStruct;
    } // _my_instance goes out of scope and `drop` function is called automatically
}
```
