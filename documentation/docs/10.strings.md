# Strings 

Strings are used to represent text data as a sequence of Unicode characters. Rust provides two main types to handle strings: String and &str. Understanding the difference between these two types is essential for working with strings effectively in Rust.

## String Type

The String type is a dynamically allocated, growable, and mutable string. It is part of the Rust standard library and is capable of storing and managing UTF-8 encoded text. Because it is dynamically allocated, a String can change its size during runtime, which makes it flexible for various use cases.

To create a String, you can use the String::from method or the to_string method (which is implemented for many types):

```rust
let strpartone = String::from("Hello, ");
let strparttwo = "world!".to_string();
let combined_string = strpartone + &strparttwo; // Use &str for concatenation
```

The + operator is used for concatenating String objects or &str references. However, keep in mind that the + operator consumes the first String and borrows the second &str. If you need to reuse str1 later, you can use the format! macro or the String::push_str method instead:

```rust
let strpartone = String::from("Hello, ");
let strparttwo = "world!";
let combined_string = format!("{}{}", strpartone, strparttwo); // Using format!
```

## &str Type (String Slices)

The &str type, pronounced "string slice," is an immutable view into a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. It is commonly used for string literals and borrowed references to String objects or other &str slices. &str slices have a fixed size at compile-time and cannot be modified.

You can create &str slices from string literals directly, or by taking a reference to a String using the & symbol:

```rust
let string_literal: &str = "Hello, world!";
let str_reference: &str = &combined_string;
```

&str slices are commonly used as function parameters when you want to pass around strings without taking ownership.

## String Methods

Both String and &str have a variety of methods for working with text data, including substring extraction, searching, replacing, and more. Some common methods include:

- len(): Returns the length of the string.
- is_empty(): Returns true if the string is empty.
- contains(): Checks if a substring is present in the string.
- split(): Splits the string into substrings based on a delimiter.
- trim(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string.
- to_lowercase() and to_uppercase(): Converts the string to lowercase or uppercase.
- replace(): Replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring.
- parse(): Converts a string to a numeric type (e.g., i32, f64, etc.).

## Unicode Support

Rust's String and &str types fully support Unicode, and Rust provides several methods to work with Unicode characters and grapheme clusters.

Additionally, the char type in Rust represents a single Unicode character. You can create a char using a single character enclosed in single quotes:

```rust
let my_char: char = 'A';
```

Rust also has good support for iterating over Unicode characters in a string using the char type, which ensures correct handling of characters with multiple bytes (e.g., emojis).
